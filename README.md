# Diffusion Crowdsensing Mechanisms
---

This repository implements two different mechanisms(algorithms) called diffusion crowdsensing mechanism with homogeneous tasks(DCM-HM) and diffusion crowdsensing mechanism with heterogeneous tasks DCM-HT.

The implementation in this repository is used in the paper "Diffusion Mechanism Design in Crowdsensing with Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Tasks" ([pdf](https://guoyuhang.me/pdfs/diffusion_mechanism_crowdsensing.pdf)).

There are two files in this repository `Simulation-dcm-hm.py` and `simulation-dcm-ht.py`.

In `Simulation-dcm-hm.py`, we compare three different mechanisms: No-Diffusion VCG, Diffusion VCG and our novel mechanism DCM-HM.

In `Simulation-dcm-ht.py`, we compare two different mechanisms: No-Diffusion VCG and our novel mechanism DCM-HT.
